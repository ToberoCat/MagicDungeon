# Magic Dungeon

Magic Dungeon is a small game I developed with a unique mechanic that allows players to cast spells by drawing shapes with their hands. The objective is to navigate through different dungeon levels and defeat enemies using these spells.

## Demo

You can try out the game [here](https://toberocat.github.io/MagicDungeon/).

## How to Play

- **Movement:**
  - WASD or Arrow Keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)
- **Spell Casting:**
  - Draw shapes within the frame to cast different spells.
- **Objective:**
  - Clear all enemies in the dungeon to spawn a ladder that will take you to the next level.

## Note

Please note that this game is still in an unpolished state. I developed it in approximately three days as an experiment with the spell casting system.
